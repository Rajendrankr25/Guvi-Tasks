Difference between Document & Windows Objects

Document Object:

The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

Window Object:

The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

Window Vs Document:

Window object : It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy
Document object : Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page.
The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
We can access a document object either using window.document property or using document object directly as window is global object.
The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods. Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. For example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.
